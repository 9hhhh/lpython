# Installation

## From a Tarball Using Pip

The easiest way is to simply `pip` install LFortran. An example:
```bash
conda create -n lfortran python=3.7
conda activate lfortran
pip install lfortran
```
This works on Linux, macOS and Windows. Pip will automatically download all
build and run time dependencies, compile and install LFortran. The only
prerequisite that you have to have is a working C compiler.

Now the `lfortran` environment has the `lfort` compiler available, you can
start the interactive prompt by executing `lfort`, or see the command line
options using `lfort -h`.

Optional: run tests:
```bash
pytest --pyargs lfortran
```

You can also install any tarball from
[https://lfortran.org/download/](https://lfortran.org/download/) directly,
e.g.:
```bash
pip install https://lfortran.github.io/tarballs/release/lfortran-0.1.14.tar.gz
```
or equivalently by:
```bash
wget https://lfortran.github.io/tarballs/release/lfortran-0.1.14.tar.gz
tar xzf lfortran-0.1.14.tar.gz
cd lfortran-0.1.14
pip install .
```


## From Git

This works on Linux, macOS and Windows:
```bash
conda create -n lfortran python=3.7 pytest llvmlite prompt_toolkit cmake make
conda activate lfortran
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime scikit-build
```
Install Java and then ANTLR, say, into `~/ext`:
```bash
export CLASSPATH="$HOME/ext/antlr-4.7-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
```
Clone the LFortran git repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran
cd lfortran
```
Build:
```bash
./build.sh
```
Run tests:
```bash
pytest
```
Run an interactive prompt:
```bash
./lfort
```

## Note About Dependencies

End users (and distributions) are encouraged to use the tarball
from [https://lfortran.org/download/](https://lfortran.org/download/),
which only depends on Python and a few Python packages (`llvmlite`, `pytest`,
`prompt_toolkit` and `antlr4-python3-runtime`). The LFortran standard library
needs to be compiled and it needs a C compiler. Down the road (see our
[roadmap](index.md)), LFortran will be gradually rewritten in C++, so it will
also depend on a C++ compiler.

The tarball is generated automatically by our CI (continuous integration) and
contains some autogenerated files: the parser, which is generated by ANTLR4
(requires Java) and the AST and ASR nodes, which is generated by an ASDL
translator (requires Python). The Java requirement is only needed when using
git directly, the tarball does not depend on Java in any way.

The same tarball is accessible from our Downloads page as well as from PyPI.
