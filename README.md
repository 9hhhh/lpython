# LPython

LPython is a Python compiler. It is in heavy development, currently in
pre-alpha stage. Some of the goals of LPython:

* The best possible performance for numerical array oriented code
* Run on all platforms
* Compile a subset of Python and be Python compatible
* Fast compilation
* Excellent user friendly diagnostic messages: error, warnings, hints, notes,
  etc.
* Ahead of time compilation to binaries and interactive usage (Jupyter
  notebook)
* Able to transform the Python code to C++, Fortran and other languages
* Explore how to design it so that it can be eventually used with any Python
  code

And more.
