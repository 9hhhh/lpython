# LPython

LPython is a Python compiler. It is in heavy development, currently in
pre-alpha stage. Some of the goals of LPython:

* The best possible performance for numerical array oriented code
* Run on all platforms
* Compile a subset of Python and be Python compatible
* Explore how to design it so that it can be eventually used with any Python
  code
* Fast compilation
* Excellent user friendly diagnostic messages: error, warnings, hints, notes,
  etc.
* Ahead of time compilation to binaries and interactive usage (Jupyter
  notebook)
* Able to transform the Python code to C++, Fortran and other languages

And more.

# Installation

LPython works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Install Conda

If you do not have Conda already installed, please follow the instructions
here to install Conda on your platform:

https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download

## Compile LPython

Create a Conda environment:

    conda create -n lp llvmdev=11.0.1 bison=3.4 re2c python cmake make toml
    conda activate lp

Create autogenerated files (choose the command for your platform):

    ./build0.sh      # macOS/Linux
    call build0.bat  # Windows

Compile LPython:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_LLVM=yes -DWITH_STACKTRACE=yes -DWITH_LFORTRAN_BINARY_MODFILES=no .
    cmake --build . -j16

## Tests:

Run tests:

    ctest
    ./run_tests.py

## Examples

You can run the following examples by hand in a terminal:

    ./src/bin/lpython examples/expr2.py
    ./a.out
    ./src/bin/lpython --show-ast examples/expr2.py
    ./src/bin/lpython --show-asr examples/expr2.py
    ./src/bin/lpython --show-cpp examples/expr2.py
    ./src/bin/lpython --show-llvm examples/expr2.py
